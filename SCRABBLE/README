These are some photos of a Scrabble-like math game that I made in what I
believe was 5th grade.  I would have been about 10 or 11, and it would
have thus been around 1985/1986.

The idea of giving people tiles and asking them to produce valid
equations from them on a Scrabble board is kind of cool, although one
can reasonably ask how much *fun* such a game can be (even if it were
designed well).

I had never seen this kind of thing, so I felt very clever of the time.
Though now that we have the Internet we can see I'm not the only one to have
pursued the idea.  For instance, there is "Equate" (1996):

There's even TuxMathScrabble (2001), an open source computer game:

You can find more variants if you search the web.  I believe that it
has more potential to be a "good game" as a computer program, because the
computer could shuffle the tiles in such a way as to give you a reasonable
shot at making an equation.  It's something that's a bit hard to really work
out with tiles selected by chance.

Speaking of which: I've included the distribution of numbers and symbols as a
file in the project.  I'm not exactly sure if there's a method to the madness
(such as not including tiles for any of the numbers between 61 and 100).
Were I to look at a design problem like this today, I'd certainly want to use
more logic than I was taught to use by that point.

Perhaps the most amusing aspect to this story was what the other kids designed
to bring in, when the assignment was to make a math game.  Two stuck out in 
particular...

One was a kid who made flashcards on index cards, and then drew monsters
on the back.  The cards were laid monster-side-up, and you were to select a
card and then do the calculation.  If you got it right, you could pick
another.  It was called KING OF THE MONSTERS and the goal of the game was
to find the King and answer his question; if you got it right then you won.

(This obviously limits the replay value; because the cards are inked and once
you know who the king is you can just go straight to that card.)

Yet adding to the hilarity is that all the monsters were just kind of similar
drawings BUT there was one card that stood out as a little pink ballerina.
So when we were playing each other's games, the first pick everyone made was
"I'll take the ballerina".

And surprise: *SHE* was the King of the Monsters!  Answer question, win game.

The other funny one was a kid who was sitting with an inflatable globe on his
desk.  The teacher gets to him and asks what his game is and he says it's
called WORLD OF MATH.  She asks how to play it, and he says he'll throw the
ball to you and ask you a math problem.  He hadn't done anything, basically.

These days I find these ideas to be hilarious.  I feel like I should have
been doing things like that for the sheer amusement.
