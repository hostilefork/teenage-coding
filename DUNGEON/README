This is an interesting case of something that I spent a little
while obsessing over as a kid, and had a design for.  But I did
not really have the tools or experience on hand to write it.
What I wanted to do was to make a 3-D dungeon game which used
the character graphics mode of the Commodore 64.

I decided as a programming exercise in the new and interesting
compiled language called "Red" to implement the vision I had.
Here you can see the designs I'd made, and compare them to
the finished result using a tool from 2013.
