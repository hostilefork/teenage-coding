		The following examples will help give you a greater appreciation
		for the power of FlexList to reduce code sizes and development
		times as well as defining a hybrid stack-queue-list-array generic
		data structure at run time.

view



		The view program reads an ascii file while building a FlexList
		of file positions of page and subpage boundaries.  As a file is
		viewed the FlexList nodes are accessed to determine the file
		position to seek.  Then that portion of the file is read and
		displayed on the screen.  This saves the file from having to be
		stored in RAM.

		The major functions of view.c are shown below.

			loadpgs()|view view.c 48		Read ascii file while building a FlexList
							of file positions of page and subpage
							boundaries.

			putpgs()|view view.c 129		This is the program's main control loop.
dump



		The dump program reads any file into a FlexList with each node
		comprising 256 byte chunks of the file.  As the file is viewed
		the FlexList nodes are accessed to retreive that portion of the
		file.

		The major functions of dump.c are shown below.

			loaddf()|view dump.c 36		Read file into a FlexList with each node
							comprising 256 byte chunks of the file.

			dump()|view dump.c 103			This is the program's main control loop.
