A good many years before counting as "teenage coding", I was 7 years old
and wrote about my opinions of my mad programming skills, on yellow notebook
paper.  Thought I'd put the scanned graphic here:

    GREATEST GAMES

    Well I started with Math1.Bas.  Then
    Math2.Bas.  Now I've discovered World war 4.
    It was 700 lines long and I wrote the
    program and Typed It in at the most 50
    minuts (<-- however you spell it).  My age is 7.
    I have written some of the best programs
    in the family when I first got the book
    Basic fun

        I learned how to write programs without
    a book at first.  I got confused and didn't
    know what things like "For I=1 to 15
    For J=1 to 100 meant.  The computer I use is
    the OSBORNE ONE.  Most working computers
    like the atari computer have things like
        Shift, Return, excape ect.
        But Remember "You Don't have to be
      a Genious to use a computer!"
