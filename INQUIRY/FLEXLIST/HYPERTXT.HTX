		A hypertext file is a text file partitioned into topics.topics

		Topics can have more than one page.pages

		A page may have highlighted text areas which are called
		hyperlinkshlinks.  Hyperlinks are references to other topics.
		Use the cursor movement keys to move between hyperlinks.

		Press <Enter> to select the topic associated with a hyperlink.
		Press <Backspace> to return to the previous topic.
		Press <ESC> to return directly to the root topic.
		Press <ESC> again to exit program.
		See also: keystoke summarykeys

		The message linemessline appearing at the bottom of the screen
		displays the name of the current topic and hypertext file
		at the left as well as the topic referenced by the current
		hyperlink, if any, towards the right.
topics



		A topic is any group of text that constitutes an idea.

		A hyperlinkhlinks embedded in the text of a topic links that
		topic to another topic.  With many hyperlinks a single
		topic could be feasibly linked to many topics.

		A topic may comprise several pages.pages

		The name of the current topic is displayed at the start
		of the message linemessline followed immediately by a "|" and
		the name of the hypertext file.

		See also: hypertext file formathtformat




		It is possible to move sequentially through the topics
		of a hypertext file even though they may not be "hyperlinked."
		Use <Ctrl Page Up> and <Ctrl Page Down> to move between
		adjacent topics and <Ctrl Home> and <Ctrl End> to move to
		the first and last topics of a hypertext file respectively.

		Use <Alt F3> to specify a topic by name.  Topic names are case
		sensitive, which means upper and lower case letters must match
		exactly in order to find the topic.

		Use <F3> to specify another hypertext file.

		See also: keystoke summarykeys

pages




		If a hypertext topic has more than one page the "PgUp/PgDn"
		message will appear on the message line at the bottom of
		the screen.


		Use the <Page Down> key now to move to the second page
		of this topic which is "pages."


		<Backspace> will return you to the previous topic.


		See also: keystoke summarykeys





		Congratulations, you have arrived - that is at the second
		page of the topic "pages."


		<Page Up> will take you back to the first page of the
		topic "pages."


		Note that <Backspace> will return you to the previous topic
		and not back to the first page of this topic!


hlinks



		Hyperlinks are keyword phrases embedded in the text of a
		topic.topics  This allows a topic to reference other topics
		which expound on the keyword idea.   In a way, this is
		like embedding the index of a book right into the text.

		A hyperlink can link to a topic in another hypertext file.
		This allows hypertext files to be interrelated.

		A hyperlink may even link to an executable file or system
		command!

		The message linemessline reveals the associated "hyperlinked"
		topic and/or file.

		See also: hypertext file formathtformat

messline



		The message line appearing at the bottom of the screen
		displays the current hypertext topic followed by a "|"
		and a hypertext file name which in the case of this topic
		is "messline|hypertxt.htx."  If this program were started
		with a path name that path name will appear prefixed to
		"hypertxt.htx."

		The current hyperlinkhlinks, if any, is shown to the right.
		If the hyperlink links to a topictopics in the current
		hypertext file, only the topic is shown.  Otherwise the
		topic is followed by a "|" and the name of the auxilary
		hypertext file.

		If the link is to an executable file, the topic portion
		will be missing with only the "|" and the name of the
		executable file appearing.

keys

		<Enter>				select topic associated with current hyperlink

		<BackSpace> 		return to previous topic

		<ESC>				return to root topic or exit

		Cursor keys &
		Home/End			move between hyperlinks

		<Page Up>/
		<Page Down>			move between pages of a topic

		<Ctrl PgUp>/
		<Ctrl PgDn>/
		<Ctrl Home>/
		<Ctrl End>			move between topics

		<F1>				hypertext help

		<F3>				load new hypertext file

		<Alt F3>			specify new topic
htformat


		When viewing a hypertext file with a word processor the
		topic and hyperlink formating characters become visible.


		A topictopics is defined on a line by itself begining in column
		one with a vertical tab character, <Ctrl K>, i.e.

		^Ktopic

		The topic continues on until the next topic or a <Ctrl X>
		in column one or the end of the file is reached.

		A topic can comprise multiple pagespages by having a line
		containing only a vertical tab in column one to indicate
		the page break, i.e.

		^K

		It's up to the hypertext file to provide formating for
		pages and lines.




		A hyperlinkhlinks appears as follows:

			^E text  ^Ktopic^X

		<Ctrl E> introduces a hyperlink and <Ctrl X> ends it.
		The <Ctrl K> separates the visible text from the name
		of the "hyperlinked" topic.


		If the topic resides in an auxilary hypertext file a "|"
		followed by a file name is appended to topic, i.e.

			^E text   ^Ktopic|filename^X


		If the topic is missing than the file is executed as
		a program:

			^E text   ^K|filename^X





		From what you have learned from this topic you should be
		able to use your word processor to create hypertext files
		that can be read by this program.

		Start out by examining this help file with your word
		processor, i.e.
