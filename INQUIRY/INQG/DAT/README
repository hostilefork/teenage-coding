NOTE: This directory contained the various bitmaps for things like arrows,
the help page, the title screen, etc.

A "PCC file" is really just another name for a PCX file:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX

Early programs used the PCC extension whenever you saved just part of your
screen, instead of the entire canvas.  The trailing "C" apparently stood
for "Cutout".  (This convention was apparently eliminated sometime after
1993 and all files were just PCX.)

The toolkit I used for dealing with PCX files had the ability to moosh
together a lot of files into one...and then load the images out that file
via API calls.  (It was something like a resource file.)  So everything
in this directory was mooshed with that archiver into something called
INQG.DAT.  This data file was expected to be in the same path as INQG.EXE
when you ran it.
