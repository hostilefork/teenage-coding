This is an interesting case of something that I spent a little
while obsessing over as a kid, and had a design for.  But I did
not really have the tools or experience on hand to write it.
What I wanted to do was to make a 3-D dungeon game which used
the character graphics mode of the Commodore 64.

I decided to make it as a programming exercise in the language Red,
which I later ported to Ren-C:
